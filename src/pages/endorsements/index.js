              Our campaign is proud to have a broad base of support from the
              grassroots, labor, political, and business communities in Houston.
              Alex has worked alongside and collaborated with many of these
              leaders to improve Houston over the past decade. Now more than
              ever, we must elect leaders who are committed to listening to
              their communities and fighting for the people they represent.

                  with his business experience, prepare him well to represent
                  Texas's 7th district in Congress. Houstonians are hardworking,

                  qualities and will be a strong and responsive representative
                  of Houston in Congress. I'm proud to endorse Alex because I
                  know he will champion the issues I fought for here in Texas:
                  supporting small business growth, fixing our broken

                path to citizenship, allowing them to lead more productive lives
                in our community. In our work together, I have witnessed his
