## Strengthening our public K-12 system for all students

Our goal is clear: we need to provide a great education for every child. Too
often, the quality of a student’s education is determined by their zip code.
Alex supports smart, consensus-driven solutions to our nation’s complex
education challenges that will improve quality for all students.

Congress should foster and encourage programs with a proven record of success,
including high-quality public, magnet, and non-profit charter programs with
strong oversight. Congress should reject plans to cut public education funding.
We should not divert tax dollars to private schools, many of which are not
subject to the same accreditation and accountability standards as our nation’s
public schools.

Congress should foster innovation at the state and local levels to transform
education by supporting efforts such as increasing access to vocational pathways
in high school or rethinking how traditional curricula prepare students for
work.

Most importantly, we need to ensure that students, parents, teachers, and
communities that are served by public schools have input into our nation’s
education policies.
