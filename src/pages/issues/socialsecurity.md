## Protecting and strengthening programs for seniors

Alex will work to protect Social Security and Medicare for seniors and future
generations. These earned benefits have helped—and must continue to help—to
provide secure retirement for millions of Americans. We must preserve Social
Security and Medicare in their current forms and reject dangerous efforts by
Republicans to dismantle these successful programs.
