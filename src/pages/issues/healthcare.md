## Achieving quality care and cost-effective coverage

Alex will work to make sure we all have access to quality and affordable health
coverage from the first day of his first term in Congress. It is both the right
thing to do morally and a smart investment in the health and well-being of our
community.

By controlling healthcare costs and fostering a sustainable health care system
that is responsive to the needs of patients, we will save taxpayers money and
improve the quality of care. In doing so, we will finally create a system that
meets the standard that the American people deserve. We will also strengthen our
economy and give entrepreneurs the freedom to create jobs and grow their
businesses by reducing the severe fluctuations in healthcare costs that they
face today.

John Culberson and other House Republicans voted for a disastrous bill that
would result in 23 million Americans losing their healthcare coverage, raise
premiums in Texas by 78%, endanger protections for people with preexisting
conditions, and do away with mandatory coverage for maternity care and
preventive health services&mdash;all while implementing an age tax that would penalize
seniors.

Republicans in Washington have co-opted the word "choice" to try to sneak a tax
cut for the rich by the American people. The Affordable Care Act provides
coverage to millions more Americans, but improvements are needed to address
root-cause challenges within the system. Alex will work tirelessly to address
those challenges.

### Providing affordable coverage to all Americans

We need to improve the quality of our healthcare system and address the problem
of extremely high costs, an issue that both Democrats and Republicans have
tolerated for far too long. Our healthcare system is not a properly functioning
market. All too often, we pay for medical services rather than patient results.
Artificially high prices are prevalent in pharmaceuticals and medical supplies,
among other areas. We must tackle the issue of high costs head-on if we expect
to create a sustainable, cost-effective healthcare system.

Alex will work with leaders and experts across the political spectrum to explore
all possible approaches to achieve affordable coverage for all Americans.

### Reducing costs and improving quality

Our healthcare payment system is fragmented and inefficient. Currently,
thousands of insurance plans have their own overhead and operational costs, and
they do not coordinate to negotiate pricing and bring down costs for consumers.
This lack of coordination contributes to higher prices, while still leaving
consumers to face challenges related to quality and access.

We must address the astronomical prices that continue to rise faster than wages
and the cost of living. In addition to encouraging coordination, we can save
billions of dollars for working families by implementing smart, patient-focused
changes to our healthcare system. Potential examples include:

* Focusing on primary, preventative, and coordinated care to avoid escalated
  health issues and unnecessary visits to the emergency room, which will keep
  people healthier and costs lower
* Paying for value in Medicare by holding physician fees constant, adjusting
  rates for overpriced services, and rewarding providers that are willing to be
  held accountable for health outcomes
* Emphasizing evidence-based policies that improve patients' healthcare
  experience, enhance health outcomes, and save money for both patients and
  taxpayers
* Tackling drug prices by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices directly with
  pharmaceutical companies, and by requiring pharmaceutical companies to clearly
  and honestly report R&D, marketing, and advertising costs

### Increasing transparency

To improve quality and decrease costs, we need a better understanding of how our
system currently operates. Transparency is lacking at nearly every level in our
healthcare system. Unlike almost any other market or transaction, patients
rarely see a full and itemized price tag for the care they receive until after
visiting the doctor.

We should increase information regarding price, quality, and other factors. We
need to enable patients to make informed choices and to better understand where
savings in healthcare spending can be achieved.

We can do so by:

* Requiring full and itemized pricing data to be shared on the front end
* Giving doctors access to information about which referral partners deliver the
  best results
* Ensuring that doctors and hospital managers have access to pricing information
  for the supplies and other resources they use
