## Continuing our fight to ensure equal justice for all

Alex knows that no value is more sacred in our country than equality. Alex has always been and always will be a firm advocate for and ally to Houston's LGBTQ community and for the rights of all individuals nationwide. We've made
important progress in recent years, most notably with the landmark Obergefell v.
Hodges U.S. Supreme Court decision ensuring marriage equality for all. We must
be vigilant in protecting this progress while continuing our fight to ensure
equal justice for all Americans.

In Congress, Alex will proudly co-sponsor the Equality Act &mdash; bipartisan
legislation that will protect LGBTQ individuals from discrimination in the
workplace, public spaces, and elsewhere. Alex will be an advocate for protecting
the LGBTQ community from violence, one of several intolerable forms of
discrimination against this community. And Alex firmly believes that those
individuals who have sacrificed and served our country in the military should
remain able to do so, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.

In short, Alex will always uphold the American values of tolerance and respect and will keep fighting until every American can grow up and live their life safely and free from discrimination, with equal access to everything our country has to offer.
