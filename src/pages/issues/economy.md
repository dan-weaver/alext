## Building an economy that works for everyone

Houston's economy is one of the largest and most diverse in the nation. We live
in a truly international city that features a robust energy sector, a vibrant
arts scene, the nation’s second busiest port, the most diverse population, and
the largest medical center in the country.

Despite Houston's limitless potential, the recent oil downturn has left many
looking for work. In Congress, Alex will focus on building an environment that
will create more jobs and better wages by fostering investment in small business
development and supporting forward-looking policies to connect people to jobs in
a changing economy.

Alex has real experience helping both small and large businesses grow. He
started a small business development program that works with entrepreneurs
looking to launch and grow their enterprises, and served on the Economic
Opportunity committee for Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner's transition team. Alex
also spent years in the private sector helping businesses grow by entering into
new markets, raising capital, and better understanding their strengths and
weaknesses.

### Growing small businesses

Small businesses drive employment, spur innovation, and create an avenue for
economic creativity, freedom, and growth. In fact, new businesses are
responsible for one out of every five new jobs created. We must ensure that
entrepreneurs with innovative ideas, regardless of where they come from, have
access to loans and technical assistance they need to be successful.

To improve entrepreneurs' ability to start and grow their businesses, Alex will
partner with small business programs across the Houston area and make sure that
Congress supports smaller, community-oriented banks—institutions that are more
likely to lend to and build longer-term relationships with small businesses.

Alex will work to ensure that our community's small businesses have the
opportunity to benefit from:

* Entrepreneurship training and technical support
* Reduced costs and other barriers, including the burden that healthcare costs
  put on small business owners
* Expanded access to capital, including venture capital, since Houston has all
  of the other elements to be one of the country’s major startup hubs
* "Small business hubs" that increase access to essential resources, such as
  legal and accounting assistance

### Creating real, sustainable job growth that reflects the future of our economy

While investor confidence in the economy may be high, we are seeing decreased
confidence from workers who need better access to training opportunities and
better visibility regarding the highest-opportunity industries for the future.
Alex will help community members achieve their full potential by working to
support:

* Leverage both employers and nonprofit organizations to develop locally guided
  workforce programs that address unemployment and underemployment issues
* Focus attention on the service sector, where there is a need for more people
  to serve as counselors, teachers, after-school coordinators, psychologists,
  community health workers, probation officers, home aides and the like
* Develop more opportunities for people to receive digital skills training so
  that they can more easily adapt to our changing economy
* Expand support for two-year technical training programs at community colleges
  and high-quality apprenticeships that prepare students with the skills to find
  good-paying jobs at a fraction of the cost of four-year colleges
