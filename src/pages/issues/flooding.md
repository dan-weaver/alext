## Making our city safer and more sustainable

Flooding from hurricane and heavy rain events poses a major threat to the sustainability and success of our city -- and puts the lives and homes of Houstonians at risk. We must do everything we can to reduce the effects that these major weather events have on people’s safety, health, and livelihoods and on our economy.

Our first priority must be to take an urgent approach to obtaining federal funding. Resources are critically needed to help rebuild the lives of the hundreds of thousands of Houstonians and Texans affected by Hurricane Harvey and by past major storms. We also need funding to make important progress with our infrastructure, including the following steps:

* Completing Project Brays, which would reduce the risk of flooding for 15,000 homes and businesses
* Cleaning out and upgrading Addicks and Barker Reservoirs, which are two of the six dams in the country that have been declared by the Army Corps of Engineers to be at an “extremely high risk of catastrophic failure”
* Potentially adding a third reservoir in the area (after careful consideration of its appropriate location)
* Building the necessary infrastructure to significantly reduce the impact of a “storm surge” from the Gulf of Mexico in and around Galveston

In addition, we can no longer rely on old and outdated models regarding the impact heavy rain and flooding will have on our city, with much of the damage in recent floods occurring outside of designated flood plains. We need new flooding policy based on more recent data.

We should also take a more balanced, people-focused approach to new development. This includes providing homeowners and potential buyers with more resources to inform them of the risks of flooding in a given area.

Lastly, we must acknowledge climate change’s role in exacerbating major weather events, incorporating its effects into our long-term planning and mitigating its role through the use of technology and other approaches.

If we make investments, acknowledge the realities of flooding, and take a proactive approach involving collaboration among all levels of government, we can build a stronger, more sustainable economy and community. For the sake of all Houstonians, but especially for more vulnerable communities and for future generations, it is our responsibility to do so.
