## Curbing climate change and creating good jobs

The vast majority of scientists and other climate experts agree that human
activity contributes to climate change. The Trump administration, with support
from Republican members of Congress, is ceding our position as a global leader
on this pressing issue.

The recent decision by President Trump to withdraw the United States from the
Paris climate accord is a serious mistake that is bad for the environment and
bad for business. In the coming decades, climate change is projected to cause
economic damage in Harris County equal to up to 5% of our economy – and for some
areas of Texas that figure is over 15%. Leading Texas energy companies have
spoken out against this withdrawal.

We cannot afford to miss the opportunity to create good jobs in the clean energy
industry—which already employs nearly 200,000 Texans per year and is growing
rapidly. We need strong leadership that will continue to grow this important
sector of our economy and create good jobs for more Texans.

Alex will fight to ensure that U.S. companies continue to develop clean energy
technology and will also support our return to global leadership on the issue of
climate change. We can create and maintain good jobs while reducing the harmful
effects of climate change.
