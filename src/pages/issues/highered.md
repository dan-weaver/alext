## Making college affordable

Today, more and more new jobs require technical skills and postsecondary
degrees. At the same time, the cost of attending college continues to rise, and
many Americans feel the increasing burden of student loan debt. We also know
that in too many programs, students aren’t finishing with the degrees and skills
they need to successfully pay back those loans.

Congress should ensure that students know the true return-on-investment of
post-secondary education options and take action to help those struggling with
debt regain sound financial footing.

We should also make it easier for students and their families to gather good
information on the performance of post-secondary programs by expanding efforts
like the College Scorecard to include employment and long-term student outcomes.

We should also ease the burden of those struggling with student loan debt by
allowing individuals to refinance their debt at current interest rates—giving
them the same flexibility they would have for a car loan or home mortgage.
